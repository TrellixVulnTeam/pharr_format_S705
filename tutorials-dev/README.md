# About

These are tutorials on how to get started using the CLTK in your research. Whereas [the CLTK official docs](https://docs.cltk.org) only explain individual functions, these notebooks are intended to be more illustrative of how you can use the functions together and answer real scholarly questions.

Pull requests are welcome.
